        <h3>Chicken</h3>
        <p class="">Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the relative ease and low cost
          of raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout the
          cuisine of cultures around the world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes.

          Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, and boiling,
          among many others, depending on its purpose. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has
          become a staple of fast food. Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful than red meat, with lower
          concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat.

          The poultry farming industry that accounts for chicken production takes on a range of forms across different
          parts of the world. In developed countries, chickens are typically subject to intensive farming methods, while
          less-developed areas raise chickens using more traditional farming techniques. The United Nations estimates
          there to be 19 billion chickens on Earth today, making them outnumber humans more than two to one.
          The modern chicken is a descendant of red junglefowl hybrids along with the grey junglefowl first raised
          thousands of years ago in the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent.

          Chicken as a meat has been depicted in Babylonian carvings from around 600 BC. Chicken was one of the most
          common meats available in the Middle Ages. For thousands of years, a number of different kinds of
          chicken have been eaten across most of the Eastern hemisphere,[8] including capons, pullets, and hens. It was
          one of the basic ingredients in blancmange, a stew usually consisting of chicken and fried onions cooked in
          milk and seasoned with spices and sugar.

          In the United States in the 1800s, chicken was more expensive than other meats and it was "sought by the rich
          because [it is] so costly as to be an uncommon dish." Chicken consumption in the U.S. increased during
          World War II due to a shortage of beef and pork. In Europe, consumption of chicken overtook that of beef
          and veal in 1996, linked to consumer awareness of Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease).

          Modern varieties of chicken such as the Cornish Cross, are bred specifically for meat production, with an
          emphasis placed on the ratio of feed to meat produced by the animal. The most common breeds of chicken
          consumed in the U.S. are Cornish and White Rock.

          Chickens raised specifically for food are called broilers. In the U.S., broilers are typically butchered at a
          young age. Modern Cornish Cross hybrids, for example, are butchered as early as 8 weeks for fryers and 12
          weeks for roasting birds.

          Capons (castrated cocks) produce more and fattier meat. For this reason, they are considered a delicacy and
          were particularly popular in the Middle Ages.
          Raw chicken may contain Salmonella. The safe minimum cooking temperature recommended by the U.S. Department of
          Health & Human Services is 165 °F (74 °C) to prevent foodborne illness because of bacteria and parasites.
          However, in Japan raw chicken is sometimes consumed in a dish called torisashi, which is sliced raw chicken
          served in sashimi style. Another preparation is toriwasa which is lightly seared on the outsides while the
          inside remains raw.

          Chicken can be cooked in many ways. It can be made into sausages, skewered, put in salads, traditionally
          grilled or by using electric grill, breaded and deep-fried, or used in various curries. There is significant
          variation in cooking methods amongst cultures. Historically common methods include roasting, baking,
          broasting, and frying. Western cuisine frequently has chicken prepared by deep frying for fast foods such as
          fried chicken, chicken nuggets, chicken lollipops or Buffalo wings. They are also often grilled for salads or
          tacos.

          Chickens often come with labels such as "roaster", which suggest a method of cooking based on the type of
          chicken. While these labels are only suggestions, ones labeled for stew often do not do well when cooked with
          other methods.

          Some chicken breast cuts and processed chicken breast products include the moniker "with rib meat". This is a
          misnomer, as it refers to the small piece of white meat that overlays the scapula, removed along with the
          breast meat. The breast is cut from the chicken and sold as a solid cut, while the leftover breast and true
          rib meat is stripped from the bone through mechanical separation for use in chicken franks, for example.
          Breast meat is often sliced thinly and marketed as chicken slices, an easy filling for sandwiches. Often, the
          tenderloin (pectoralis minor) is marketed separately from the breast (pectoralis major). In the US, "tenders"
          can be either tenderloins or strips cut from the breast. In the UK the strips of pectoralis minor are called
          "chicken mini-fillets".

          Chicken bones are hazardous to health as they tend to break into sharp splinters when eaten, but they can be
          simmered with vegetables and herbs for hours or even days to make chicken stock.

          In Asian countries it is possible to buy bones alone as they are very popular for making chicken soups, which
          are said to be healthy. In Australia the rib cages and backs of chickens after the other cuts have been
          removed are frequently sold cheaply in supermarket delicatessen sections as either "chicken frames" or
          "chicken carcasses" and are purchased for soup or stock purposes.
